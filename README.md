# Choose Your Own Adventure

This project will give the user the ability to book an entire trip itinerary from one site. The user can put in given parameters and we will return travel options based on the input. User can specify budget, weather, travel dates and moe to return various itineraries.

# User Story

As a user who wants to travel
I want to minimize planning
So that I can adventure often

# Minimum User requirements

Page should be responsive and usable on multiple devices (mobile & desktop).
User can create an account to save their itinerary.
User should be able to search using travel dates to have it return a given amount of itinerary options.
User will be able to view flight options, 5 hotels and 5 places to eat.
User will see a preview of possible itineraries.
User can click on any given itinerary to display the itinerary in the adventure div

# Additional Usability Additions

User can create a countdown to add to their user profile.
User is able to add additional Search Parameters:
*Climate
*Things to see and do
\*Region

# Business Information

Will use free API's from Rapid API. Booking.com API to find prices for flights based on date range. We will call on additional APIs for things to do and the weather for the region. Biggest challenge we are facing is the speed of the return on the site. The more AJAX calls the longer it will take to load and we want to keep the UI fast.

Additionally, there is space to add and expand search fields and the info that is returned and appeded on the page. Starting with basic card links but thinking modals will also be useful for returning information to the User.
